Component Breakdown: Reusable ProductCard & Data Flow
1. SECTION: Product Card Component (ProductCard.jsx)
Requirement: Create a self-contained, reusable React component that can display product informationâ€”specifically its name, price, and stock statusâ€”based on data passed into it.

Implementation:

A functional React component named ProductCard is defined, which accepts a single argument: the props object.

Props Destructuring ({ name, price, inStock }) is used to cleanly extract the expected data points from the props object into local variables.

The component's structure is defined using JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript. It renders a main <div> with a class of product-card to serve as the container.

Inside the container, an <h3> element displays the name, and two <p> elements display the price and stock status.

A ternary operator (inStock ? 'In Stock' : 'Out of Stock') is used to conditionally render the stock status string based on the boolean value of the inStock prop. This allows the component's output to change dynamically based on the data it receives.

VALID BEHAVIOR:

When the component is used in another file (like App.jsx) and given the props name="Wireless Mouse", price={25.99}, and inStock={true}, it will render a card displaying "Wireless Mouse", "Price: $25.99", and "Status: In Stock".

If the inStock prop is changed to {false}, the component will automatically re-render to display "Status: Out of Stock" without any other code changes.

INVALID BEHAVIOR:

If a prop is not passed (e.g., the name prop is omitted), the component will render without a name, but it will not crash. The space for the name will simply be empty.

If an invalid data type is passed (e.g., a string for inStock instead of a boolean), the ternary operator's logic may produce unexpected results.

2. CSS Styling Breakdown: A Structured Overview
ELEMENT: body (Global Layout)

background-color: #f4f4f7: Sets a light grey background for the entire page, providing a neutral backdrop that makes the content card stand out.

font-family: Establishes a clean, modern, and highly readable default sans-serif font for the application.

ELEMENT: .container (Main App Layout)

display: flex, justify-content: center: These Flexbox properties are used to arrange the product cards in a row and center them horizontally on the page.

max-width, margin: auto: These ensure the main content area is a reasonable width on larger screens and remains centered.

ELEMENT: .product-card (The Product Card Itself)

background-color: #fff, border-radius, box-shadow: These properties style the component as a distinct "card." The white background, rounded corners, and subtle shadow lift it off the page, giving it a clean, modern appearance and a sense of depth.

border: 1px solid #e0e0e0: Adds a light border that clearly defines the card's boundaries.

3. JavaScript/JSX Logic Breakdown
State & Props Management:

Props (properties): This is the core concept of the experiment. Props are a mechanism for passing data one-way from a parent component (App.jsx) down to a child component (ProductCard.jsx). The ProductCard is "dumb"â€”it only knows how to display the data it's given.

App.jsx as the "Data Source": The App.jsx component acts as the parent. It holds the actual product data and is responsible for rendering three separate instances of ProductCard, passing a unique set of props to each one. This demonstrates the reusability of the child component.

Conditional Rendering: The logic inStock ? 'In Stock' : 'Out of Stock' is a key piece of dynamic behavior. It's an inline if-else statement that checks the inStock boolean and returns a different string based on its value. This allows the UI to react instantly to changes in data.

Event Handling:

This experiment does not involve direct user event handling (like clicks or mouse movements) within the ProductCard component itself. Instead, its "event" is the act of receiving props. When a parent component's state changes (which is not demonstrated in this specific experiment but is a core React concept), it re-renders its children with new props, causing them to update.

Key Functions & Concepts:

Component Reusability: The primary goal. By creating one ProductCard.jsx file, we can generate an unlimited number of product cards with different data just by reusing the component tag <ProductCard ... /> in the App.jsx file. This is a foundational principle of efficient React development.

JSX (JavaScript XML): A syntax that allows developers to write HTML-like structures directly within JavaScript code. This makes creating component templates intuitive and powerful. For example, {name} within a JSX tag is an expression that tells React to render the value of the name variable.

Component Composition: The App component is composed of other components. It includes a title (<h2>) and a div that contains multiple ProductCard components. This hierarchical structure is how complex user interfaces are built in React.
