Component Breakdown: Product Filter & Display
1. SECTION: Filter Dropdown & Product Grid
Requirement: Provide a dropdown menu for category selection and a product grid that dynamically updates to display only the items matching the chosen category.

Implementation:

An HTML <select> element (#categoryFilter) provides the filtering options (e.g., "All", "Electronics").

A <div> (#productList) acts as a container where the product cards are dynamically rendered by JavaScript.

An array of product objects in JavaScript serves as the single source of truth for the data.

A change event listener is attached to the <select> element. When the user selects a new option, it triggers a filtering function. This function filters the main product array and calls a separate display function to update the UI.

VALID BEHAVIOR:

The page loads with "All" selected by default, and all products are visible in the grid.

When a user selects a specific category from the dropdown (e.g., "Apparel"), the grid instantly updates to show only apparel items.

Choosing "All" again makes all products reappear.

The entire filtering process occurs instantly without reloading the page.

INVALID BEHAVIOR:

If JavaScript is disabled, the product list will not be rendered at all, and the dropdown menu will have no effect on the page.

2. CSS Styling Breakdown: A Structured Overview
ELEMENT: body & .container (Global Layout & Theming)

font-family, background-color: Sets a clean, sans-serif font and a light gray background for a modern, readable appearance.

max-width: 1200px, margin: 0 auto: Constrains the main content's width and centers it on the page, ensuring a balanced layout on wider screens.

ELEMENT: .product-grid (Product List Layout)

display: grid: Utilizes the powerful CSS Grid layout model to organize the product cards.

grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr)): This is the core of the responsive layout. It creates a flexible grid where columns are at least 250px wide, and they automatically fill the available space, reflowing as the screen size changes.

gap: 20px: Adds consistent spacing between each product card in the grid.

ELEMENT: .product-item (Individual Product Card)

background-color, border-radius, box-shadow: Styles the card with a white background, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow to make it appear elevated from the page.

padding: 20px: Creates internal spacing, preventing the content from touching the edges of the card.

transition: transform 0.2s: Adds a smooth animation, causing the card to slightly lift when the user hovers over it, providing interactive feedback.

ELEMENT: .category (Category "Pill")

background-color, padding, border-radius: Styles the category text as a small, pill-shaped tag for clear visual separation and emphasis.

3. JavaScript Logic Breakdown
Data Structure:

const products = [...]: Product data is stored in an array of objects. This approach cleanly separates the data from the HTML, making the application easier to manage and scale. Each object contains key-value pairs for name, category, and price.

Element Selection:

document.getElementById('productList'): Selects the grid container.

document.getElementById('categoryFilter'): Selects the dropdown menu.

Core Functions:

displayProducts(items): A crucial, reusable function that handles the rendering of products. It first clears any existing content from the productListContainer and then iterates over the provided items array. For each item, it dynamically creates a <div>, populates it with the product's data using a template literal, and appends it to the container.

filterProducts(): This is the main logic handler. It reads the value of the selected dropdown option. If the value is "all", it calls displayProducts with the original, complete products array. Otherwise, it uses the .filter() array method to create a new array containing only the products whose category property matches the selected value, and then passes this new filtered array to displayProducts.

Event Handling & Initial Load:

categoryFilter.addEventListener('change', filterProducts): This line connects the user's action to the filtering logic. It listens for the change event on the dropdown and executes the filterProducts function each time a new option is selected.

displayProducts(products): The script calls this function once when the page initially loads to populate the grid with all available products.
