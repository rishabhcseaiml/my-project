A simple Node.js and Express.js backend demonstrating API authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 
This project includes a login route for token generation and middleware to protect a secure route.

This project is a lightweight backend server built with Node.js and Express.js that implements a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

It features a POST /login endpoint that validates hardcoded user credentials and, upon success, generates a signed JWT. It also includes a GET /protected route that is secured by a custom middleware. This middleware intercepts incoming requests, validates the Bearer token from the Authorization header, and only allows authenticated users to access the protected resource.

This example clearly demonstrates the core concepts of token-based authentication:

Token Generation: Issuing a signed token on login.

Middleware: Intercepting and verifying tokens.

Route Protection: Blocking unauthorized (401) or forbidden (403) requests.

## Key Features (For a Resume or Portfolio Project)
Built a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to manage user authentication.

Implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure, stateless authentication.

Developed a /login endpoint to issue signed tokens to validated users.

Created custom middleware to verify Bearer tokens, successfully protecting API routes from unauthorized access.

Managed API responses for successful logins (200), missing tokens (401), and invalid tokens (403).
