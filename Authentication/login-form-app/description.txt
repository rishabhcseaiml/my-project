 A responsive login component with form fields for username and password.
- Styling provided in src/login.css for consistent layout, spacing, and simple error states.
- Client-side validation for required fields and basic input checks.
- Submission flow that posts credentials to a backend /login endpoint and handles responses.
- Success handling: stores an authentication token (e.g., JWT) in localStorage and redirects to protected views.
- Error handling: displays server or validation errors to the user in a concise manner.
- Simple logging and visual feedback during network requests (loading and error states).

Learning outcomes:
- Building reusable form components and applying modular CSS.
- Implementing client-side validation and UX-friendly error messages.
- Integrating frontend form flows with an authentication API and managing tokens securely in the browser.
- Understanding the basics of protecting routes on the client and coordinating with backend authentication.
