Component Breakdown: Live Character Counter
1. SECTION: Text Input & Counter
Requirement: Provide a text input area and a real-time display of the number of characters typed.

Implementation:

Uses an HTML <textarea> element for multi-line text input.

A <div> with the ID char-counter serves as the display for the count.

A JavaScript input event listener is attached to the textarea, which triggers a function every time the user types, pastes, or deletes text.

VALID BEHAVIOR:

The counter starts at "0 Characters".

As the user types, the number in the counter increases with each character.

When the user deletes text, the number decreases accordingly.

The text correctly displays "1 Character" when there is only one character and "X Characters" for all other counts (including 0).

Pasting text into the area updates the count to the new total instantly.

INVALID BEHAVIOR:

If JavaScript is disabled, the counter will remain at its initial state ("0 Characters") and will not update.

2. CSS Styling Breakdown: A Structured Overview
ELEMENT: body (Global Layout & Theming)

display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;: Uses Flexbox to perfectly center the main content container in the middle of the page.

min-h-screen: Ensures the body takes up at least the full height of the viewport.

bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900: Sets a light gray background by default and a dark gray background if the user's system is in dark mode.

font-family: 'Inter': Applies the "Inter" font to all text for a clean, modern look.

ELEMENT: .w-full.max-w-2xl (Main Content Card)

bg-white dark:bg-gray-800: Sets the card's background to white in light mode and dark gray in dark mode.

rounded-2xl shadow-lg: Creates a modern aesthetic with large rounded corners and a distinct shadow.

p-6 md:p-8: Applies generous padding inside the card, which increases on medium-sized screens and larger for better spacing.

ELEMENT: textarea#text-input (Text Input Field)

w-full h-48: Makes the textarea span the full width of its container with a fixed height of 48 units.

border rounded-xl: Adds a standard border and rounded corners.

focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500: Enhances user experience by adding a blue outline (ring) when the textarea is clicked or tabbed into.

resize-none: Prevents the user from manually resizing the textarea, maintaining a consistent layout.

ELEMENT: div#char-counter (Counter Display)

absolute bottom-4 right-4: Positions the counter inside the bottom-right corner of its parent container (the div wrapping the textarea). This requires the parent to have a relative position.

bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-600: Gives the counter a distinct background color that adapts to the theme.

px-3 py-1 rounded-full: Styles the counter as a "pill" shape with horizontal and vertical padding.

text-sm font-medium: Sets the font size to small and the weight to medium for clear readability without being distracting.

3. JavaScript Logic Breakdown
Element Selection:

document.getElementById('text-input'): Selects the textarea element.

document.getElementById('char-counter'): Selects the counter display element.

Event Handling:

textInput.addEventListener('input', ...): This is the core of the functionality. The input event is the most effective way to listen for any change to the value of an input field, including typing, deleting, pasting, and cutting.

Update Logic:

const currentLength = textInput.value.length;: Inside the event listener, this line gets the total number of characters currently in the textarea.

charCounter.textContent = \${currentLength} Character${currentLength !== 1 ? 's' : ''}`;: This template literal efficiently builds the string to be displayed. It uses a ternary operator (condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`) to add an "s" to "Character" only when the character count is not equal to 1.
