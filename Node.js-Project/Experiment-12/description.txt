Of course. Here is a description and the key learnings for the Concurrent Ticket Booking System project.

Project Description
This project involves creating a ticket booking API using Node.js and Express.js that simulates a real-world scenario where multiple users might try to book the same seat at the same time. The primary challenge is to handle these concurrent requests safely to prevent issues like double-booking.

The solution is a seat locking mechanism. When a user selects a seat, the API places a temporary lock on it, making it unavailable to others for a short period (e.g., one minute). Within this window, only the user who locked the seat can proceed to confirm the booking. If the booking isn't confirmed, the lock expires automatically, and the seat becomes available again. The entire state of the seats (e.g., available, locked, booked) is managed within an in-memory data structure for simplicity. The API includes endpoints to view all seats, lock a specific seat, and confirm a booking, with clear error messages for invalid actions like trying to lock an already booked seat.

Key Learnings
This project provides crucial insights into building robust, multi-user applications:

Handling Concurrency and Race Conditions: This is the core takeaway. You'll gain a practical understanding of what a race condition is and implement a locking strategy to prevent it, ensuring data integrity when multiple operations happen simultaneously. üèéÔ∏è

Complex State Management: You will learn to manage a dynamic, in-memory state. This involves designing a data structure to track not just if a seat is available or booked, but also if it's temporarily locked, who locked it, and when that lock expires.

Designing Multi-Step Processes (Workflows): You'll practice designing an API that follows a specific user workflow (view seats -> lock a seat -> confirm booking). This is a common pattern in applications that involve transactions, like e-commerce checkouts or reservation systems.

Asynchronous Timers for Business Logic: You'll use asynchronous JavaScript functions like setTimeout to implement the lock expiration feature. This is a powerful technique for handling time-sensitive state changes automatically on the server. ‚è≥

Building Robust Business Logic: You'll go beyond basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to implement complex rules that govern the booking process. This enhances your ability to translate real-world requirements into functional code.

Defensive Programming: The project forces you to anticipate and handle various edge cases and invalid user actions, improving your ability to build resilient and error-proof applications.
